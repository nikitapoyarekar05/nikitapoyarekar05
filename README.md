**Clarity:** I invest time in understanding the problem and the people behind it, clients, users, and teams. This ensures alignment before writing a single line of code.

**Collaboration:** I’ve worked in distributed, cross-functional teams and understand the nuances of remote collaboration. I value clear communication, structured updates, and transparency throughout the project lifecycle.

**Craftsmanship:** Clean, readable code, reusable components, and performance optimization aren’t afterthoughts, they’re built into my workflow. I follow modern best practices in accessibility, testing (Jest, Cypress), and deployment automation to ensure smooth delivery.
